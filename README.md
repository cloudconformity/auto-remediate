# [Cloud Conformity](https://www.cloudconformity.com/?utm_source=github) Auto Remediation

## Disclaimer
This early "Auto Remediation" is subject to change. Cloud Conformity will use commercially reasonable efforts to support the previous version of the project.
This project is provided on an ‘AS IS’ and ‘WHEN AVAILABLE’ basis.  Cloud Conformity has no liability to user as a result of any changes made to their AWS infrastructure by installing this project.

Auto Remediation is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by Cloud Conformity team.

## How it works

The following image shows how Cloud Conformity Auto Remediation works:

![Cloud Conformity Auto Remediation](images/how-it-works.png)

Here's an example:

1. A user makes an S3 bucket publicly readable via S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs)
2. Cloud Conformity identifies the risk in real-time
3. Cloud Conformity publishes a message to the specified SNS Topic
3. SNS topic triggers the Orchestrator lambda function which in turns calls S3 bucket auto-remediate function
4. S3 BucketPublicReadAccess Auto Remediate Function (AutoRemediateS3-001) updates the S3 bucket ACL and closes the security gap


## Installation
1. Go to the official [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)  and follow the instructions to install the framework
2. Create a working copy of "Cloud Conformity Auto Remediation" repository by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudconformity/auto-remediate.git
```
3. Change directory to auto-remediation:

```bash
cd auto-remediate
```
4. `IMPORTANT` Update `functions/config.js` with required configurations. Please note that all the rules in config file are disabled by default to prevent unwanted changed. User needs to enabled the ones they need manually.
5. `IMPORTANT` Make any other necessary adjustments before deployment.
6. Run `npm install` before deploying so that the node_modules folder would be available to AWS

```bash
npm install
```
7. Finally deploy

```bash
serverless deploy --region us-west-2
```

## How to contribute

You are welcome to contribute to "Cloud Conformity Auto Remediation"

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project
2. Make a well commented and clean commit to the repository
3. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

## Styleguide

The styleguide used for this project is
[Standard](https://standardjs.com/) forced by [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).
To run eslint, you only need to run `npm run lint [filename]` or to
run for the whole project, run `npm run lint '**/*.js'`.
Refer to package.json for more info.

The main rules are as follows:
* 2 spaces – for indentation
* Single quotes for strings – except to avoid escaping
* No unused variables – this one catches tons of bugs!
* No semicolons – It's fine. Really!
* Never start a line with (, [, or `
* Space after keywords if (condition) { ... }
* Space after function name function name (arg) { ... }
* Always use === instead of == – but obj == null is allowed to check null || undefined.
* Always handle the node.js err function parameter
* Always prefix browser globals with window – except document and navigator are okay
